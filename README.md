# ai-tips-and-notes

This repository was created as a result of trying to help myself work with AI more efficiently. The following is a compilation of all my learnings while working on several AI projects (especially generative AI projects).


## What's inside?

This repository contains a collection of tips and notes that I've compiled while working with AI. It includes:

- [A mental model for working with AI](./development/mental-model.md)
- [A curated list of AI tools for developers](./development/tools.md) (WIP)
- [A guide for working with Langgraph](./langgraph/langgraph-guide.md) (Soon)
- [A guide for working with Langchain](./langchain/langchain-guide.md) (Soon)
